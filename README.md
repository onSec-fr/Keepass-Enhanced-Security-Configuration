### Introduction
[KeePass](https://keepass.info "KeePass") is a great tool to store your passwords securely for personnal use.

On the other hand its popularity leads to a risk since there are [many ways to attack Keepass](https://blog.harmj0y.net/redteaming/keethief-a-case-study-in-attacking-keepass-part-2/ "many ways to attack Keepass") nowadays.
Furthermore the large number of features increases the potential attack surface.

So the goal is to limit some features you don't need and to activate all security mechanisms that are not activated by default.

To do this we will use the [enforced configuration file](https://keepass.info/help/kb/config_enf.html "enforced configuration file"), which is an official KeePass feature.

### General considerations
In order to further secure your installation, please remember to apply the following recommendations: 

- Download KeePass **[from its official website](https://keepass.info "from its official website")** only and **[check the integrity of the downloaded file](https://keepass.info/integrity.html "check the integrity of the downloaded file")**.
- **Secure your KeePass installation directory** so that only your user account can write to it (to protect the integrity of your configuration file).
- **Increase the number of iterations of the derivation key** used to encrypt your database (default is 60000).
- **Secure your database [with a key file](https://keepass.info/help/base/keys.html#keyfiles "with a key file")** in addition to the master password. Note that the key file should not be stored in the same location as your database.
- **Consider using version 1.x**, which has fewer features but is also more secure by design. See **[edition comparison](https://keepass.info/compare.html "edition comparison")**.

### Automatic installation
You can use the **KeePass_Secure_Auto_Install.ps1** file to install and configure KeePass automatically !
> If you don't want to, just copy the *KeePass.config.enforced.xml* file to the root of the KeePass installation directory.

What the script does:
1. **Download the latest version** of KeePass from its official website
2. **Checks the integrity** of the file by comparing its hash
3. **Copy the enforced configuration file**
4. **Alter permissions** on the KeePass installation folder

#### Parameters
- **ConfigFile** : Optional - path to the KeePass.config.enforced.xml (Default : .\KeePass.config.enforced.xml).
- **EnforceACL** Optional - secure KeePass installation directory using ACLs (Default : True).

#### Run
**Default** : `.\KeePass_Secure_Auto_Install.ps1`  
**Custom** : `.\KeePass_Secure_Auto_Install.ps1 -ConfigFile "C:\path\to\file.xml" -EnforceACL $False`

### Configuration file
From [official documentation ](https://keepass.info/help/kb/config_enf.html#info "official documentation "): 
> The format of an enforced configuration file is basically the same as the format of a regular configuration file. An enforced configuration file must be stored in the KeePass application directory (which contains KeePass.exe). Its name depends on the KeePass edition:
> - KeePass 1.x: KeePass.enforced.ini.
> - KeePass 2.x: KeePass.config.enforced.xml.

#### Sample file
Here is an example file, which embeds most of the important security mechanisms, and disables dangerous features :
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

#### Screenshots
- As you can see the settings are now enforced :

- KeePass process is now protected from dumping and alteration :

- Plugins and others specified settings are now disallowed :

#### More settings
The settings are poorly documented, but if you want to play around, there is a way :
> In order to create an enforced configuration file, we recommend the following procedure:
> 1. Download the portable ZIP package of KeePass and unpack it. Run KeePass, configure everything as you wish, and exit it.
> 2. Rename the configuration file to the enforced configuration file name.
> 3. Open the enforced configuration file with a text editor and delete all settings that you do not want to enforce.

### FAQ
> Am I protected from keyloggers using this configuration ?
- **Yes and no**. Most currently available keyloggers work only on normal desktops; they do not capture keypresses on secure desktops. So, if you enable the MasterKeyOnSecureDesktop setting, the master key is protected against most keyloggers.

> Is my keepass database protected from an attacker who has access to my machine?
- **Definitely not**. There are multiple ways to recover passwords in memory, or by abusing certain features. Note that if the attacker has write access to your configuration file, he can simply modify or delete it.

> Is there a better password manager for personal use ?
- Everyone will have their own opinion on this. What I can say is that Keepass is a very good free and open source password manager. The product has been affected by [very few CVEs](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-12214/Keepass.html "[very few CVEs") over the past ten years. None of them were critical.
